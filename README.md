# Tweets
Using R to: pull tweets from twitter, conduct sentiment analysis, create graphs of sentiment and total tweets, and wordcloud of tweets containing to keyword "police".

This project serves a few purposes: 1) it will be submitted as part of my term paper for a graduate forensics course, 2) it allowed me to learn R, and 3) it gave me a better understanding of sentiment analysis in R.

Credit must be given to Wayne Weiai Xu(2016) and Julie Sigle (2015) whose work greatly assisted in the creation of this project.
